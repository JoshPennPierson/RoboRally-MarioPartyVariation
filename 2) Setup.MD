SETUP
---

It is possible to play with two or more players. However, this game works best with more than two players, and even better if there are an even number players, as two of the multiplayer games involve teams.

Players select four 16x16 boards and place them in a square. This can be done randomly or as decided by the players.

Whenever something needs to be placed on the boards at random, use the following method:

If you have 5 Six-Sided Dice:
- Roll 1 die to determine which board. 1-4 corresponds to the boards. 5 = person second to last gets to pick the board. 6 = person in last gets to pick the board.
- Roll 2 dice added together to determine x-coordinate on the board.
- Roll 2 dice added together to determine y coordinate on the board.
Always count from the middle of all 4 boards out towards the edges of whichever board was randomly selected (see "3) Gameplay.txt" for determining places).

2 twelve-sided dice and 1 four-sided dice:
- Roll all of the dice.
- The four-sided dice determines which board.
- The first twelve-sided die determines the x-coordinate on the board.
- The second twelve-sided die determines the y-coordinate on the board.
Always count from the center of all 4 boards out towards the edges of whichever board was randomly selected (see `3) Gameplay.MD` for determining places).

All 6 green and all 6 red flags are placed on the boards either at random or as chosen by players. Green flags are now equivalent to single wrenches and red flags are now equivalent to double wrenches.

All 3 Game Guy markers are placed on the board either at random or as chosen by players. Any time someone plays a Game Guy game, move all of the Game Guy Markers to new random locations.

A star (green chit) is randomly placed on the board. Any time someone get a star, randomly place a new star.

There is only one respawn location. It is located on one of the four center squares or any other single square all players agree on (or randomly placed). You do not update your respawn location ever. All players have unlimited lives. When you respawn, you may always choose the direction you are facing (after receiving your program cards for the turn).
