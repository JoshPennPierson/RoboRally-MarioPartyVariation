RoboRally-MarioPartyVariation
=============================

A fast-paced and exciting new rule set for the board game Robo Rally. Works best with extra option cards (also helps if someone is familiar with Mario Party, specifically Mario Party 3).

Advantages:

- Everyone is always going for the same star/flag so you're bound to run into each other more, and it's easier for people in last to catch up. With unlimited lives, you can kill your bot (find a pit or something) to get back to the center of the map when the new star is placed instead of having to always cross the entire board and be lagging behind.
- MiniGames give variety to the relatively slow and repetitive pace of a normal Robo Rally. Even with MiniGames, the overall games can be shorter than most regular 4 board RoboRally games.
- MiniGames ensure that players get lots of option cards, which is always fun.
- While the rules are more complex for beginners, this game mode actually makes it easier for beginners to stay competitive throughout a session.

Disadvantages:

- Works best with a lot of option cards and a custom blank 8x8 board, so you might have to do a bit of work to make them.
- Can be a lot to understand if players are not yet familiar with RoboRally.
